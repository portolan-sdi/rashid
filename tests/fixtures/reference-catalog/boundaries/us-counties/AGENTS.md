# Agent Guidance, United States Counties (2023, 1:500k)

County polygons whose value is the `GEOID` column, the five-digit FIPS
key to US county statistics. Join ACS and decennial downloads on
`GEOIDFQ` instead, it matches their GEO_ID column verbatim. `COUNTYNS`
is the identifier that survives FIPS changes across years.

Query the GeoParquet `data` asset in place with DuckDB spatial, read_parquet('us-counties.parquet'), or load it with GeoPandas. It streams over HTTP range requests, so query the published URL directly rather than downloading first. For rendering use the visual PMTiles asset with its MapLibre styles.

## Quirks

- GEOID is a zero-padded string. Cast it to integer and Alabama's 01001
  becomes 1001, silently unjoining every state below FIPS 10. CSV
  round-trips are the usual culprit.
- NAME is wildly ambiguous, 31 Washingtons, and independent cities
  collide with the counties that share their name. Baltimore city is
  24510, Baltimore County is 24005. The lowercase word city in NAMELSAD
  is what marks an independent city.
- Connecticut has nine planning regions, GEOIDs 09110 to 09190, LSAD
  PL, since the 2022 change. Datasets keyed to the old 09001 to 09015
  match nothing here.
- Aleutians West Census Area crosses the antimeridian, so its stored
  bbox spans nearly all longitudes and it passes almost every naive
  bbox filter. Handle it before bbox-windowing the world.
- Geometry is clipped to shoreline but AWATER is not, so San
  Francisco's polygon covers 122 km2 while ALAND plus AWATER is 601
  km2. Offshore points in legal county water fall in no polygon.

## Coordinate Reference System

EPSG:4269, NAD83, a geographic coordinate reference system whose coordinates are in degrees.
Planar distance and area functions return degrees and square degrees, which are not ground units and vary with latitude. For real distances and areas use a sphere or spheroid function, or transform to a projected CRS first.
The `data` asset carries the same code as `proj:code`.

The spheroid function works here once `geometry_always_xy` is set.
Without it 1,646 of the 3,235 counties return NaN, which reads like a
geometry problem and is not. Transforming to an equal-area CRS is
still the better habit, since it leaves you somewhere you can measure,
and the query below does that.

```sql
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;
SELECT NAMELSAD,
       round(ST_Area(ST_Transform(geom, 'EPSG:4269', 'EPSG:5070', always_xy := true)) / 1e6, 1) AS km2,
       round(ALAND / 1e6, 1) AS aland_km2
FROM read_parquet('us-counties.parquet') WHERE GEOID = '08031';
-- Denver County, 400.7 km2 from geometry, 396.5 km2 of official land.
```

For web mapping, treating the NAD83 coordinates as WGS84 shifts
nothing visible at this generalization level.

## Tested Queries

Counties per state.

```sql
SELECT STUSPS, count(*) AS n
FROM read_parquet('us-counties.parquet')
GROUP BY STUSPS ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 5;
-- Texas 254, Georgia 159, Virginia 133, Kentucky 120, Missouri 115.
```

Which county contains a point, longitude first.

```sql
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;
SELECT GEOID, NAMELSAD, STUSPS
FROM read_parquet('us-counties.parquet')
WHERE ST_Contains(geom, ST_Point(-104.9903, 39.7392));
-- 08031, Denver County, CO.
```

Cheap spatial windows from the bbox covering column.

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM read_parquet('us-counties.parquet')
WHERE bbox.xmin > -109.06 AND bbox.xmax < -102.04
  AND bbox.ymin > 36.99 AND bbox.ymax < 41.01;
-- 62 of Colorado's 64 counties, two generalized bboxes nick the state line.
```
