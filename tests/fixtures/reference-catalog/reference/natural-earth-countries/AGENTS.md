# Agent Guidance, Natural Earth Countries (1:110m)

World country polygons for joins and rollups, not for legal boundaries
or precise areas. The stable key is `ADM0_A3`. External statistics join
on `ISO_A3_EH` or `ISO_A2_EH`. The raw `ISO_A3` and `ISO_A2` columns
hold the sentinel -99 for France, Norway, Kosovo, Northern Cyprus, and
Somaliland, so a filter like ISO_A3 = 'FRA' matches nothing.

Query the GeoParquet `data` asset in place with DuckDB spatial, read_parquet('natural-earth-countries.parquet'), or load it with GeoPandas. It streams over HTTP range requests, so query the published URL directly rather than downloading first. For a quick preview use the thumbnail asset.

## Quirks

- -99 is the global no-data sentinel, in the ISO columns and in numeric
  columns like TINY and MAPCOLOR13. Check for it before trusting a value.
- France includes French Guiana as one row, so its bbox spans from
  South America to Europe and bbox filters on South America catch France.
- South Sudan is `SDS` here but `SSD` in the populated places file. An
  `ADM0_A3` join between the two layers drops it unless you remap.
- Antarctica is a country row with population 4,490, and the continent
  column also holds Seven seas (open ocean) for the French Southern and
  Antarctic Lands.
- Russia and Fiji cross the antimeridian, so their bboxes span the full
  longitude range and naive bbox-width logic breaks.

## CRS, Degrees In, Degrees Out

EPSG:4326, longitude and latitude in degrees. `ST_Area(geom)` returns
square degrees, which makes Greenland read nearly as large as Brazil.
For real areas use the spheroid function, and flip coordinates first
because DuckDB's geodesic functions expect latitude first.

```sql
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;
SELECT NAME, round(ST_Area_Spheroid(ST_FlipCoordinates(geom)) / 1e6) AS km2
FROM read_parquet('natural-earth-countries.parquet')
ORDER BY km2 DESC LIMIT 5;
-- Russia 17,018,507 then Antarctica, Canada, United States, China.
-- Without the flip, Brazil returns 5.2M km2 instead of 8.5M and 33
-- countries return NaN.
```

## Tested Queries

Population by continent.

```sql
SELECT CONTINENT, count(*) AS countries, sum(POP_EST)::BIGINT AS pop
FROM read_parquet('natural-earth-countries.parquet')
GROUP BY CONTINENT ORDER BY pop DESC;
-- Asia 4.55B across 47 rows, Africa 1.31B across 51, eight groups in all.
```

Which country contains a point.

```sql
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;
SELECT NAME, ADM0_A3
FROM read_parquet('natural-earth-countries.parquet')
WHERE ST_Contains(geom, ST_Point(13.405, 52.52));
-- Germany, DEU. ST_Point takes longitude first.
```
