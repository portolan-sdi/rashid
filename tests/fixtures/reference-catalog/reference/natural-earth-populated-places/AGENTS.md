# Agent Guidance, Natural Earth Populated Places (1:50m)

Curated world city points that join to the countries Collection on
`ADM0_A3`. Join by attribute, never spatially. 113 of the 1,251 points,
Istanbul, Montevideo, and Geneva among them, fall outside their own
country's generalized 1:110m polygon because coastal simplification
pushes them offshore.

Query the GeoParquet `data` asset in place with DuckDB spatial, read_parquet('natural-earth-populated-places.parquet'), or load it with GeoPandas. It streams over HTTP range requests, so query the published URL directly rather than downloading first. For a quick preview use the thumbnail asset.

## Quirks

- The United States capital is spelled with two spaces after the comma,
  so NAME = 'Washington, D.C.' matches nothing. Use LIKE 'Washington%'
  or ADM0CAP = 1 with ADM0_A3 = 'USA'.
- South Sudan is `SSD` here but `SDS` in the countries file. Remap one
  side before joining, or Juba, Malakal, and Wau drop out.
- The legacy LATITUDE and LONGITUDE columns diverge from the geometry
  by up to 0.22 degrees. They are old label anchors, read `geom`.
- The UN time series columns POP1950 through POP2050 are populated only
  for the 463 UN-tracked agglomerations, zero elsewhere, and POP2050 is
  a projection.
- 59 places carry POP_MAX below 1,000, mostly stations and outposts, so
  population filters silently drop real capitals of small territories.

## Coordinate Reference System

EPSG:4326, WGS 84, a geographic coordinate reference system whose coordinates are in degrees.
Planar distance functions return degrees, which are not ground units and vary with latitude. For real distances use a sphere or spheroid function, or transform to a projected CRS first.
The `data` asset carries the same code as `proj:code`.

The same CRS as the countries Collection, so the two overlay and join
without a transform. Nearest-neighbour work wants
`ST_Distance_Sphere`, which needs `geometry_always_xy` set first, as
the query below does.

## Tested Queries

Capitals per continent, with the country join done correctly.

```sql
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;
SELECT c.CONTINENT, count(*) AS capitals
FROM read_parquet('natural-earth-populated-places.parquet') p
JOIN read_parquet('../natural-earth-countries/natural-earth-countries.parquet') c
  ON (CASE p.ADM0_A3 WHEN 'SSD' THEN 'SDS' ELSE p.ADM0_A3 END) = c.ADM0_A3
WHERE p.ADM0CAP = 1
GROUP BY c.CONTINENT ORDER BY capitals DESC;
-- Africa 52, Asia 45, Europe 39, then the Americas and Oceania.
```

Nearest city to a point, distance in kilometres.

```sql
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;
SET geometry_always_xy = true;
SELECT NAME, ADM0NAME,
       round(ST_Distance_Sphere(geom, ST_Point(-122.4783, 37.8199)) / 1000, 1) AS km
FROM read_parquet('natural-earth-populated-places.parquet')
ORDER BY km LIMIT 3;
-- San Francisco 8.0 km, San Jose 75.2 km, Sacramento 121.7 km.
```
