"""Score a mutmut run against the ``.mutation-baseline`` floor.

Synced from portolan-sdi/portolan-ops (templates/repo/scripts/).
Edit it there. Local changes are overwritten on the next sync.

Both mutation jobs share this module so the parse-and-enforce logic lives in one
tested place instead of duplicated shell: the nightly sweep and the PR-scoped
diff job each run ``mutmut``, export ``mutmut-cicd-stats.json``, then call this
script to enforce the floor and render a GitHub step-summary table.

Scoring:
    killed_total = killed + timeout + suspicious   # the suite reacted
    testable     = killed_total + survived          # no_tests excluded
    kill_rate    = killed_total / testable * 100

``no_tests`` mutants (no covering test at all) are outside the suite's reach and
are excluded from the rate rather than counted as failures. ``timeout`` and
``suspicious`` mutants provoked a reaction from the suite, so they count as
killed. Zero testable mutants means mutmut produced or parsed nothing — that is
mutation testing being broken, never a pass.

Two floors:
    ``.mutation-baseline`` holds one repo-wide floor, the catastrophe guard every
    run must clear. The nightly sweep scores a rotating ``1/NUM_SHARDS`` slice
    whose kill rate depends on which modules land in it — measured shard rates
    span 18% to 95% — so one repo-wide number either flaps or gates nothing.
    ``--shard`` adds the per-shard floor recorded in ``.mutation-shards.json``:
    a shard must hold its own recorded rate (minus a tolerance for timeout
    jitter), which catches a regression the repo-wide floor would sleep through.
    A shard with no recorded rate yet is gated by the repo-wide floor alone, and
    the run prints the line to record.

Usage:
    python scripts/mutation_score.py \\
        --stats mutants/mutmut-cicd-stats.json \\
        --baseline .mutation-baseline \\
        [--shards .mutation-shards.json --shard 8 --num-shards 25] \\
        [--summary "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"] [--label "changed files"]

Exit codes: 0 = at or above floor; 1 = below floor, zero testable, or bad input.
